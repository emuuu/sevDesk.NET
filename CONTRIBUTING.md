## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Branch from `main`** — create a feature or fix branch (e.g. `feat/my-feature` or `fix/issue-42`).
2. **Write tests** — all new functionality should include unit tests.
3. **Fill out the PR template** — describe what changed and why.
4. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. Avoid unrelated formatting or refactoring.
5. **Ensure CI passes** — all builds and tests must be green.

## Code Style

This project uses an `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting. Please ensure your editor respects it:

- 4 spaces indentation (no tabs)
- UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings
- PascalCase for public members, `_camelCase` for private fields
- `System` usings sorted first
